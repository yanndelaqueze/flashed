# Flashed

Flashed is the perfect companion for all Flash Invader players (https://space-invaders.com/flashinvaders/)

## Features

Flashed lets you :
- See the map with cities where there's been an Invasion
- Browse the list of all referrenced Invaders, filter by city, status (destroyed, alive, damaged...)
- Know what Invaders are located inside a radius you define (around your position or an address you specify)
- Get more detailled information on an Invader (date, status, reports from other users...)
- add an invader to your flash-list
- edit the info on the invader you bookmarked (add coordinates, photo, comment, status : flashed/to-flash)
- See your Invader flash-list, with filters (status, city...)
- Make a report on an invader you bookmarked (mainly let other people know if this Invader was destroyed or damaged)
- See info on another user or yourself (stats on Invaders flashed, cities explored etc...)

NB : Only admins can create new cities and new Invaders



## Happy Flashing !!!
